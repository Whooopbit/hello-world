I'm new to the data world in general. I'm an inspiring data scinece because I see the value it brings to the world.I'm a former division one fotball player and Pro Arena football player. I started linebacker and was team captain at the University of Nevada as well for my Pro Arena team. I would like to bring that same leadership and drive to the world of data.
